# Open Source Arras
Formerly (and commonly) known as APS++

This is an open beta build of an advanced private server template for Arras.io, independent from the official client. If you're familiar with `arras-template`, you'll be familiar with this.

This is **not** representative of the final product. Some things may not either be present or work correctly.

## Requirements

In order to run your server via localhost, you will need to install these first:
- [Node.js v16 or later](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)

Once the required software is installed open run.bat, and assuming there aren't any errors, your server will start up. Go to localhost:3000 in your favourite web browser (keep the command prompt open, closing it will shut down the server) to play.
